            <UL>

             <p>Testing is intended to show that a program does what it is intended to do and to dis
             cover program defects before it is put into use. When you test software, you execute
             a program using artificial data. You check the results of the test run for errors, anom
             alies, or information about the program’s non-functional attributes.
             The testing process has two distinct goals:</p>


            <p>1. To demonstrate to the developer and the customer that the software meets its
              requirements. For custom software, this means that there should be at least one
             test for every requirement in the requirements document. For generic software
             products, it means that there should be tests for all of the system features, plus
             combinations of these features, that will be incorporated in the product release</p>

             <p> 2. To discover situations in which the behavior of the software is incorrect, unde
             sirable, or does not conform to its specification. These are a consequence of
             software defects. Defect testing is concerned with rooting out undesirable sys
             tem behavior such as system crashes, unwanted interactions with other systems,
             incorrect computations, and data corruption.</p>


           

            <p> The first goal leads to validation testing, where you expect the system to perform
             correctly using a given set of test cases that reflect the system’s expected use. The
             second goal leads to defect testing, where the test cases are designed to expose
             defects. The test cases in defect testing can be deliberately obscure and need not
             reflect how the system is normally used. Of course, there is no definite boundary
             between these two approaches to testing. During validation testing, you will find
             defects in the system; during defect testing, some of the tests will show that the pro
             gram meets its requirements.</p>


            <p>The diagram shown in Figure 8.1 may help to explain the differences between
             validation testing and defect testing. Think of the system being tested as a black
             box. The system accepts inputs from some input set I and generates outputs in an
             output set O. Some of the outputs will be erroneous. These are the outputs in set Oe
             that are generated by the system in response to inputs in the set Ie. The priority in
             defect testing is to find those inputs in the set Ie because these reveal problems with
             the system. Validation testing involves testing with correct inputs that are outside Ie.
             These stimulate the system to generate the expected correct outputs.</p>

            <p>Testing cannot demonstrate that the software is free of defects or that it will
             behave as specified in every circumstance. It is always possible that a test that you
             have overlooked could discover further problems with the system. As Edsger
             Dijkstra, an early contributor to the development of software engineering, eloquently
             stated (Dijkstra et al., 1972):</p>

            <p> Testing can only show the presence of errors, not their absence</p>

            <p> Testing is part of a broader process of software verification and validation (V & V).
             Verification and validation are not the same thing, although they are often confused</p>

            <center><img src="image/Image1.png"></center>


            <p> Barry Boehm, a pioneer of software engineering, succinctly expressed the difference
             between them (Boehm, 1979):</p>
       

            
          
        
              <li>‘Validation: Are we building the right product?’</li>
              <li>‘Verification: Are we building the product right?’</li>

            

                 <p> Verification and validation processes are concerned with checking that software
             being developed meets its specification and delivers the functionality expected by the
             people paying for the software. These checking processes start as soon as requirements
             become available and continue through all stages of the development process.</p>

                 <p>The aim of verification is to check that the software meets its stated functional and
             non-functional requirements. Validation, however, is a more general process. The aim
             of validation is to ensure that the software meets the customer’s expectations. It goes
             beyond simply checking conformance with the specification to demonstrating that the
             software does what the customer expects it to do. Validation is essential because, as 
             I discussed in Chapter 4, requirements specifications do not always reflect the real
             wishes or needs of system customers and users.</p>

            </ul>
            

            <ul>
                <p> The ultimate goal of verification and validation processes is to establish confi
             dence that the software system is ‘fit for purpose’. This means that the system must
             be good enough for its intended use. The level of required confidence depends on the
             system’s purpose, the expectations of the system users, and the current marketing
             environment for the system:</p>

            

                <p>1. Software purpose The more critical the software, the more important that it is
             reliable. For example, the level of confidence required for software used to con
             trol a safety-critical system is much higher than that required for a prototype
             that has been developed to demonstrate new product ideas.</p>

             <p> 2. User expectations Because of their experiences with buggy, unreliable software,
             many users have low expectations of software quality. They are not surprised
             when their software fails. When a new system is installed, users may tolerate</p>

                <center><img src="image/Image2.png"></center>

             <p><b>Figure 8.2 </b>Inspections and testing</p>

             <p>failures because the benefits of use outweigh the costs of failure recovery.
             In these situations, you may not need to devote as much time to testing the soft
             ware. However, as software matures, users expect it to become more reliable so
             more thorough testing of later versions may be required.</p>

            <p> 3. Marketing environment When a system is marketed, the sellers of the system
             must take into account competing products, the price that customers are willing
             to pay for a system, and the required schedule for delivering that system. In a
             competitive environment, a software company may decide to release a program
             before it has been fully tested and debugged because they want to be the first
             into the market. If a software product is very cheap, users may be willing to tol
             erate a lower level of reliability</p>

            

             <p> As well as software testing, the verification and validation process may involve
             software inspections and reviews. Inspections and reviews analyze and check the
             system requirements, design models, the program source code, and even proposed
             system tests. These are so-called ‘static’ V & V techniques in which you don’t need
             to execute the software to verify it. Figure 8.2 shows that software inspections and
             testing support V & V at different stages in the software process. The arrows indicate
             the stages in the process where the techniques may be used.</p>

             <p>Inspections mostly focus on the source code of a system but any readable repre
             sentation of the software, such as its requirements or a design model, can be
             inspected. When you inspect a system, you use knowledge of the system, its applica
             tion domain, and the programming or modeling language to discover errors.
             There are three advantages of software inspection over testing:</p>

            

            <p>1. During testing, errors can mask (hide) other errors. When an error leads to
             unexpected outputs, you can never be sure if later output anomalies are due to
             a new error or are side effects of the original error. Because inspection is a
             static process, you don’t have to be concerned with interactions between
             errors. Consequently, a single inspection session can discover many errors in a system</p>

                  <center><img src=" image/Image3.png"></center>

             <p> 2. Incomplete versions of a system can be inspected without additional costs. If
             a program is incomplete, then you need to develop specialized test harnesses
             to test the parts that are available. This obviously adds to the system development costs.</p>

                <p> 3. As well as searching for program defects, an inspection can also consider
             broader quality attributes of a program, such as compliance with standards,
             portability, and maintainability. You can look for inefficiencies, inappropriate
             algorithms, and poor programming style that could make the system difficult to
             maintain and update.</p>

               <P> Program inspections are an old idea and there have been several studies and
             experiments that have demonstrated that inspections are more effective for defect
             discovery than program testing. Fagan (1986) reported that more than 60% of the
             errors in a program can be detected using informal program inspections. In the
             Cleanroom process (Prowell et al., 1999), it is claimed that more than 90% of defects
             can be discovered in program inspections.</P>

            <P>However, inspections cannot replace software testing. Inspections are not good
             for discovering defects that arise because of unexpected interactions between dif
             ferent parts of a program, timing problems, or problems with system perfor
             mance. Furthermore, especially in small companies or development groups, it can
             be difficult and expensive to put together a separate inspection team as all poten
             tial members of the team may also be software developers. I discuss reviews and
             inspections in more detail in Chapter 24 (Quality Management). Automated static
             analysis, where the source text of a program is automatically analyzed to discover
             anomalies, is explained in Chapter 15. In this chapter, I focus on testing and testing processes.</P> 

            </ul>

            <ul>
                <P> Figure 8.3 is an abstract model of the ‘traditional’ testing process, as used in plan
             driven development. Test cases are specifications of the inputs to the test and the
             expected output from the system (the test results), plus a statement of what is being
             tested. Test data are the inputs that have been devised to test a system. Test data can
             sometimes be generated automatically, but automatic test case generation is impossible, 
             as people who understand what the system is supposed to do must be involved to
             specify the expected test results. However, test execution can be automated. The
             expected results are automatically compared with the predicted results so there is no
             need for a person to look for errors and anomalies in the test run.</P>

            <p><b>Figure 8.3</b> A model of the software testing process Inspections and testing</p>

                <P>Typically, a commercial software system has to go through three stages of testing:</P>

               <P>
                    1. Development testing, where the system is tested during development to discover
                 bugs and defects. System designers and programmers are likely to be involved
                 in the testing process.</P>

               <P>
                    2. Release testing, where a separate testing team tests a complete version of the
                 system before it is released to users. The aim of release testing is to check that
                 the system meets the requirements of system stakeholders.</P>


               <P> 
                    3. User testing, where users or potential users of a system test the system in their
                 own environment. For software products, the ‘user’ may be an internal marketing group 
                 who decide if the software can be marketed, released, and sold.
                 Acceptance testing is one type of user testing where the customer formally tests
                 a system to decide if it should be accepted from the system supplier or if further development is required</P>

               <P>mated testing. In manual testing, a tester runs the program with some test data and
                 compares the results to their expectations. They note and report discrepancies to the
                 program developers. In automated testing, the tests are encoded in a program that is
                 run each time the system under development is to be tested. This is usually faster
                 than manual testing, especially when it involves regression testing—re-running pre
                 vious tests to check that changes to the program have not introduced new bugs.</P>

               <P> The use of automated testing has increased considerably over the past few years.
                 However, testing can never be completely automated as automated tests can only
                 check that a program does what it is supposed to do. It is practically impossible to use
                 automated testing to test systems that depend on how things look (e.g., a graphical
                 user interface), or to test that a program does not have unwanted side effects</P>

    
               <H2 style ="text-align: center; background-color: #23804b;"> 8.1 Development testing </H2>

                    <P> Development testing includes all testing activities that are carried out by the team
                 developing the system. The tester of the software is usually the programmer who
                 developed that software, although this is not always the case. Some development
                 processes use programmer/tester pairs (Cusamano and Selby, 1998) where each</P>

                               <center><img src="image/Image5.png"></center>

               <p> programmer has an associated tester who develops tests and assists with the testing
                     process. For critical systems, a more formal process may be used, with a separate
                     testing group within the development team. They are responsible for developing tests
                     and maintaining detailed records of test results.</p>

                  <p>During development, testing may be carried out at three levels of granularity:</p>

                     <p>
                             1. Unit testing, where individual program units or object classes are tested. Unit
                             testing should focus on testing the functionality of objects or methods.</p>

                     <p>
                             2. Component testing, where several individual units are integrated to create com
                             posite components. Component testing should focus on testing component interfaces.</p>

                        <p>3. System testing, where some or all of the components in a system are integrated
                             and the system is tested as a whole. System testing should focus on testing component interactions.</p>


                        <p>Development testing is primarily a defect testing process, where the aim of testing
                         is to discover bugs in the software. It is therefore usually interleaved with debugging—
                         the process of locating problems with the code and changing the program to fix these problems</p>
                           
                     
                     
                        <h2 style ="text-align: center; background-color: #23804b;">>8.1.1 Unit testing</h2>


                    <p> Unit testing is the process of testing program components, such as methods or object
                 classes. Individual functions or methods are the simplest type of component. Your
                 tests should be calls to these routines with different input parameters. You can use
                 the approaches to test case design discussed in Section 8.1.2, to design the function or method tests.</p>

                    <p>When you are testing object classes, you should design your tests to provide coverage of all of the features of the object. This means that you should:</p>

                        <ul>
                              <li> test all operations associated with the object;</li>
                                <li> set and check the value of all attributes associated with the object;</li>
                                <li> put the object into all possible states. This means that you should simulate all events that cause a state change</li>

                        </ul>

                   <center><img src="image/Image6.png"></center>

                    <p> Consider, for example, the weather station object from the example that I discussed
                 in Chapter 7. The interface of this object is shown in Figure 8.4. It has a single attribute,
                 which is its identifier. This is a constant that is set when the weather station is installed.
                 You therefore only need a test that checks if it has been properly set up. You need to
                 define test cases for all of the methods associated with the object such as reportWeather,
                 reportStatus, etc. Ideally, you should test methods in isolation but, in some cases, some
                 test sequences are necessary. For example, to test the method that shuts down the
                 weather station instruments (shutdown), you need to have executed the restart method.</p>

                    <p> Generalization or inheritance makes object class testing more complicated. You
                 can’t simply test an operation in the class where it is defined and assume that it will
                 work as expected in the subclasses that inherit the operation. The operation that is
                 inherited may make assumptions about other operations and attributes. These may
                 not be valid in some subclasses that inherit the operation. You therefore have to test
                 the inherited operation in all of the contexts where it is used.</p>

                    <p> To test the states of the weather station, you use a state model, such as the one
                 shown in Figure 7.8 in the previous chapter. Using this model, you can identify
                 sequences of state transitions that have to be tested and define event sequences to
                 force these transitions. In principle, you should test every possible state transition
                 sequence, although in practice this may be too expensive. Examples of state
                 sequences that should be tested in the weather station include:</p>

                 <p>Shutdown → Running → Shutdown
                     Configuring → Running → Testing → Transmitting → Running
                 Running → Collecting → Running → Summarizing → Transmitting → Running</p>

                     <p> Whenever possible, you should automate unit testing. In automated unit testing,
                 you make use of a test automation framework (such as JUnit) to write and run your
                 program tests. Unit testing frameworks provide generic test classes that you extend
                 to create specific test cases. They can then run all of the tests that you have imple
                 mented and report, often through some GUI, on the success or failure of the tests. Anentire test suite can often be run in a few seconds 
                 so it is possible to execute all the tests every time you make a change to the program.An automated test has three parts</p>

                   <p> 1. A setup part, where you initialize the system with the test case, namely the inputs and expected outputs</p>

                   <p> 2. A call part, where you call the object or method to be tested.</p>

                     <p> 3. An assertion part where you compare the result of the call with the expected result.
                     If the assertion evaluates to true, the test has been successful; if false,then it has failed</p>


                    <p>Sometimes the object that you are testing has dependencies on other objects that
                 may not have been written or which slow down the testing process if they are used.
                 For example, if your object calls a database, this may involve a slow setup process
                 before it can be used. In these cases, you may decide to use mock objects. Mock
                 objects are objects with the same interface as the external objects being used that
                 simulate its functionality. Therefore, a mock object simulating a database may have
                 only a few data items that are organized in an array. They can therefore be accessed
                 quickly, without the overheads of calling a database and accessing disks. Similarly,
                 mock objects can be used to simulate abnormal operation or rare events. For example, 
                 if your system is intended to take action at certain times of day, your mock
                 object can simply return those times, irrespective of the actual clock time</p>
    

             <h2 style ="text-align: center; background-color: #23804b"> 8.1.2 Choosing unit test cases</h2>

               <p>Testing is expensive and time consuming, so it is important that you choose effective
             unit test cases. Effectiveness, in this case, means two things:</p>

                  <p>1. The test cases should show that, when used as expected, the component that you
                    are testing does what it is supposed to do.</p>

                  <p> 2. If there are defects in the component, these should be revealed by test cases.</p>

                <p> You should therefore write two kinds of test case. The first of these should reflect
             normal operation of a program and should show that the component works. For
             example, if you are testing a component that creates and initializes a new patient
             record, then your test case should show that the record exists in a database and that
             its fields have been set as specified. The other kind of test case should be based on
             testing experience of where common problems arise. It should use abnormal inputs
             to check that these are properly processed and do not crash the component.</p>

               <p>I discuss two possible strategies here that can be effective in helping you choose test cases. These are:</p>

               <ul>
                   
                <p>  1. Partition testing, where you identify groups of inputs that have common charac
                   eristics and should be processed in the same way. You should choose tests from within each of these groups.</p>


                  <p> 2. Guideline-based testing, where you use testing guidelines to choose test cases.
                     These guidelines reflect previous experience of the kinds of errors that program
                     mers often make when developing components</p>


                       <center> <img src="image/Image7.png"></center>
               
               </ul>
                
               <p> The input data and output results of a program often fall into a number of different classes with common characteristics. 
             Examples of these classes are positive numbers, negative numbers, and menu selections. Programs normally behave in a
             comparable way for all members of a class. That is, if you test a program that does a
             computation and requires two positive numbers, then you would expect the program
             to behave in the same way for all positive numbers.</p>

                 <p> Because of this equivalent behavior, these classes are sometimes called equiva
             lence partitions or domains (Bezier, 1990). One systematic approach to test case
             design is based on identifying all input and output partitions for a system or component. 
             Test cases are designed so that the inputs or outputs lie within these partitions.
             Partition testing can be used to design test cases for both systems and components.</p>

                <p> In Figure 8.5, the large shaded ellipse on the left represents the set of all possible
             inputs to the program that is being tested. The smaller unshaded ellipses represent
             equivalence partitions. A program being tested should process all of the members of
             an input equivalence partitions in the same way. Output equivalence partitions are
             partitions within which all of the outputs have something in common. Sometimes
             there is a 1:1 mapping between input and output equivalence partitions. However,
             this is not always the case; you may need to define a separate input equivalence par
             tition, where the only common characteristic of the inputs is that they generate out
             puts within the same output partition. The shaded area in the left ellipse represents
             inputs that are invalid. The shaded area in the right ellipse represents exceptions that
             may occur (i.e., responses to invalid inputs).</p>

                 <p>Once you have identified a set of partitions, you choose test cases from each of
             these partitions. A good rule of thumb for test case selection is to choose test cases
             on the boundaries of the partitions, plus cases close to the midpoint of the partition.
             The reason for this is that designers and programmers tend to consider typical values
             of inputs when developing a system. You test these by choosing the midpoint of the
             partition. Boundary values are often atypical (e.g., zero may behave differently from
             other non-negative numbers) so are sometimes overlooked by developers. Program
             failures often occur when processing these atypical values</p>


                     <center><img src="image/Image8.png"></center>

                 <p> You identify partitions by using the program specification or user documentation
             and from experience where you predict the classes of input value that are likely to
             detect errors. For example, say a program specification states that the program
             accepts 4 to 8 inputs which are five-digit integers greater than 10,000. You use this
             information to identify the input partitions and possible test input values. These are
             shown in Figure 8.6.</p>

                 <p>When you use the specification of a system to identify equivalence partitions, this
             is called ‘black-box testing’. Here, you don’t need any knowledge of how the system
             works. However, it may be helpful to supplement the black-box tests with ‘white
             box testing’, where you look at the code of the program to find other possible tests.
             For example, your code may include exceptions to handle incorrect inputs. You can
             use this knowledge to identify ‘exception partitions’—different ranges where the
             same exception handling should be applied.</p>

                 <p> Equivalence partitioning is an effective approach to testing because it helps
             account for errors that programmers often make when processing inputs at the edges
             of partitions. You can also use testing guidelines to help choose test cases.
             Guidelines encapsulate knowledge of what kinds of test cases are effective for dis
             covering errors. For example, when you are testing programs with sequences, arrays,
             or lists, guidelines that could help reveal defects include:</p>

                     
         <ul>

         <ul>

            <p>  1. Test software with sequences that have only a single value. Programmers natu
                 rally think of sequences as made up of several values and sometimes they embed
                 this assumption in their programs. Consequently, if presented with a single
                 value sequence, a program may not work properly.</p>

                     <p> 2. Use different sequences of different sizes in different tests. This decreases the
                 chances that a program with defects will accidentally produce a correct output
                 because of some accidental characteristics of the input.</p>

                    <p> 3. Derive tests so that the first, middle, and last elements of the sequence are
                 accessed. This approach is reveals problems at partition boundaries</p>

               <center><img src="image/Image9.png"></center>

                 <p> Whittaker’s book (2002) includes many examples of guidelines that can be used
                 in test case design. Some of the most general guidelines that he suggests are:</p>

         
             <li>Choose inputs that force the system to generate all error messages;</li>
             <li>Design inputs that cause input buffers to overflow;</li>
             <li>Repeat the same input or series of inputs numerous times;</li>
             <li> Force invalid outputs to be generated</li>
             <li>Force computation results to be too large or too small.</li>  
       
                <p>As you gain experience with testing, you can develop your own guidelines about
             how to choose effective test cases. I give more examples of testing guidelines in the
             next section of this chapter.</p>
            </ul>

 


         <h2 style ="text-align: center; background-color: #23804b;"> 8.1.3 Component testing</h2>

            <p>Software components are often composite components that are made up of several
             interacting objects. For example, in the weather station system, the reconfiguration
             component includes objects that deal with each aspect of the reconfiguration. You
             access the functionality of these objects through the defined component interface.
             Testing composite components should therefore focus on showing that the component interface
             behaves according to its specification. You can assume that unit tests
             on the individual objects within the component have been completed.</p>

            <p> Figure 8.7 illustrates the idea of component interface testing. Assume that components A, B, and C have been integrated
             to create a larger component or subsystem. The test cases are not applied to the individual components but rather to the interface
             of the composite component created by combining these components. Interface errorsin the composite component may not be detectable by testing the individual objects
             because these errors result from interactions between the objects in the component.</p>

                <p> There are different types of interface between program components and, consequently, 
                    different types of interface error that can occur:</p>

                        <p> 1. Parameter interfaces These are interfaces in which data or sometimes function
                         references are passed from one component to another. Methods in an object
                         have a parameter interface.</p>

                            <center><img src="image/image10.png"></center>

                         <p> 2. Shared memory interfaces These are interfaces in which a block of memory is
                         shared between components. Data is placed in the memory by one subsystem
                         and retrieved from there by other sub-systems. This type of interface is often
                         used in embedded systems, where sensors create data that is retrieved and
                         processed by other system components.</p>

                         <p> 3. Procedural interfaces These are interfaces in which one component encapsu
                         lates a set of procedures that can be called by other components. Objects and
                         reusable components have this form of interface.</p>

                        <p> 4. Message passing interfaces These are interfaces in which one component
                         requests a service from another component by passing a message to it. A return
                         message includes the results of executing the service. Some object-oriented sys
                        tems have this form of interface, as do client–server systems</p>


                 <p> Interface errors are one of the most common forms of error in complex systems
                (Lutz, 1993). These errors fall into three classes:</p>
               </ul>
          <ul>
                <li> Interface misuse A calling component calls some other component and makes an
             error in the use of its interface. This type of error is common with parameter inter
             faces, where parameters may be of the wrong type or be passed in the wrong
             order, or the wrong number of parameters may be passed</li>
                <li> Interface misunderstanding A calling component misunderstands the specification of the 
             interface of the called component and makes assumptions about its
             behavior. The called component does not behave as expected which then causes
             unexpected behavior in the calling component. For example, a binary search
             method may be called with a parameter that is an unordered array. The search
             would then fail.</li>
                <li>Timing errors These occur in real-time systems that use a shared memory or a
             message-passing interface. The producer of data and the consumer of data may
             operate at different speeds. Unless particular care is taken in the interface design,
             the consumer can access out-of-date information because the producer of the
             information has not updated the shared interface information</li>

         </ul>

                <p>Testing for interface defects is difficult because some interface faults may only
             manifest themselves under unusual conditions. For example, say an object imple
             ments a queue as a fixed-length data structure. A calling object may assume that the
             queue is implemented as an infinite data structure and may not check for queue over
             flow when an item is entered. This condition can only be detected during testing by
             designing test cases that force the queue to overflow and cause that overflow to cor
             rupt the object behavior in some detectable way.</p>

                <p> A further problem may arise because of interactions between faults in different
             modules or objects. Faults in one object may only be detected when some other object
             behaves in an unexpected way. For example, an object may call another object to
             receive some service and assume that the response is correct. If the called service is
             faulty in some way, the returned value may be valid but incorrect. This is not immediately 
             detected but only becomes obvious when some later computation goes wrong.
             Some general guidelines for interface testing are:</p>

                        <p> 1. Examine the code to be tested and explicitly list each call to an external component.
                     Design a set of tests in which the values of the parameters to the external
                     components are at the extreme ends of their ranges. These extreme values are
                     most likely to reveal interface inconsistencies.</p>

                        <p> 2. Where pointers are passed across an interface, always test the interface with null
                     pointer parameters.</p>

                        <p> 3. Where a component is called through a procedural interface, design tests that
                     deliberately cause the component to fail. Differing failure assumptions are one
                     of the most common specification misunderstandings.</p>

                         <p> 4. Use stress testing in message passing systems. This means that you should
                     design tests that generate many more messages than are likely to occur in practice. 
                     This is an effective way of revealing timing problems.</p>

                        <p> 5. Where several components interact through shared memory, design tests that
                     vary the order in which these components are activated. These tests may reveal
                     implicit assumptions made by the programmer about the order in which the
                     shared data is produced and consumed</p>

                 <p> Inspections and reviews can sometimes be more cost effective than testing for
             discovering interface errors. Inspections can concentrate on component interfaces
             and questions about the assumed interface behavior asked during the inspection
             process. A strongly typed language such as Java allows many interface errors to be
             trapped by the compiler. Static analyzers (see Chapter 15) can detect a wide range
             of interface errors</p>





            <h2  style ="text-align: center; background-color: #23804b;"> 8.1.4 System testing</h2>

                <p> System testing during development involves integrating components to create a version of 
             the system and then testing the integrated system. System testing checks that
             components are compatible, interact correctly and transfer the right data at the right
             time across their interfaces. It obviously overlaps with component testing but there
             are two important differences:</p>

                     <p> 1. During system testing, reusable components that have been separately developed and 
             off-the-shelf systems may be integrated with newly developed components.
             The complete system is then tested.</p>

                    <p> 2. Components developed by different team members or groups may be integrated
             at this stage. System testing is a collective rather than an individual process. In
             some companies, system testing may involve a separate testing team with no
             involvement from designers and programmers.</p>

                 <p> When you integrate components to create a system, you get emergent behavior.
             This means that some elements of system functionality only become obvious when
             you put the components together. This may be planned emergent behavior, which
             has to be tested. For example, you may integrate an authentication component with a
             component that updates information. You then have a system feature that restricts
             information updating to authorized users. Sometimes, however, the emergent
             behavior is unplanned and unwanted. You have to develop tests that check that the
             system is only doing what it is supposed to do.</p>

                 <p> Therefore system testing should focus on testing the interactions between the
             components and objects that make up a system. You may also test reusable components 
             or systems to check that they work as expected when they are integrated with
             new components. This interaction testing should discover those component bugs that
             are only revealed when a component is used by other components in the system.
             Interaction testing also helps find misunderstandings, made by component developers, 
             about other components in the system.</p>

                <p> Because of its focus on interactions, use case–based testing is an effective
             approach to system testing. Typically, each use case is implemented by several com
             ponents or objects in the system. Testing the use case forces these interactions to occur. 
             If you have developed a sequence diagram to model the use case implementation,
             you can see the objects or components that are involved in the interaction.</p>

                        <center><img src="image/Image11.png"></center>

                        <center><p><b> Figure 8.8</b>  Collectweather data sequence chart</p></center>


                <p>To illustrate this, I use an example from the wilderness weather station system
             where the weather station is asked to report summarized weather data to a remote
             computer. The use case for this is described in Figure 7.3 (see previous chapter).
             Figure 8.8 (which is a copy of Figure 7.7) shows the sequence of operations in the
             weather station when it responds to a request to collect data for the mapping system.
             You can use this diagram to identify operations that will be tested and to help design
             the test cases to execute the tests. Therefore, issuing a request for a report will result
             in the execution of the following thread of methods:</p>

                 <p> SatComms:request → WeatherStation:reportWeather → Commslink:Get(summary)
             →WeatherData:summarize</p>

                 <p> The sequence diagram helps you design the specific test cases that you need as it
             shows what inputs are required and what outputs are created:</p>

                 <p> 1. An input of a request for a report should have an associated acknowledgment.
             A report should ultimately be returned from the request. During testing, you
             should create summarized data that can be used to check that the report is
             correctly organized.</p>

                 <p> 2. An input request for a report to WeatherStation results in a summarized report
             being generated. You can test this in isolation by creating raw data corre
            sponding to the summary that you have prepared for the test of SatComms and
             checking that the WeatherStation object correctly produces this summary. This
             raw data is also used to test the WeatherData object. Of course, I have simplified the sequence diagram in Figure 8.8 so that it does not
             show exceptions. A complete use case/scenario test must also take these into account
             and ensure that objects correctly handle exceptions.</p>


                 <p> For most systems, it is difficult to know how much system testing is essential and
             when you should to stop testing. Exhaustive testing, where every possible program
             execution sequence is tested, is impossible. Testing, therefore, has to be based on a
             subset of possible test cases. Ideally, software companies should have policies for
             choosing this subset. These policies might be based on general testing policies, such
             as a policy that all program statements should be executed at least once.
             Alternatively, they may be based on experience of system usage and focus on testing
             the features of the operational system. For example:</p>

            
         
                 <p>1. All system functions that are accessed through menus should be tested.</p>

                 <p> 2. Combinations of functions (e.g., text formatting) that are accessed through the
             same menu must be tested.</p>

                 <p> 3. Where user input is provided, all functions must be tested with both correct and
             incorrect input</p>
        

                <p> It is clear from experience with major software products such as word processors
             or spreadsheets that similar guidelines are normally used during product testing.
             When features of the software are used in isolation, they normally work. Problems
             arise, as Whittaker (2002) explains, when combinations of less commonly used fea
             tures have not been tested together. He gives the example of how, in a commonly
             used word processor, using footnotes with a multicolumn layout causes incorrect
             layout of the text.</p>

                <p>Automated system testing is usually more difficult than automated unit or component testing. 
             Automated unit testing relies on predicting the outputs then encoding
             these predictions in a program. The prediction is then compared with the result.
             However, the point of implementing a system may be to generate outputs that are
             large or cannot be easily predicted. You may be able to examine an output and check
             its credibility without necessarily being able to create it in advance.</p>




            <h2 style ="text-align: center; background-color: #23804b;">  8.2 Test-driven development</h2>
               
               
               <p> Test-driven development (TDD) is an approach to program development in which
                 you interleave testing and code development (Beck, 2002; Jeffries and Melnik,2007).
                 Essentially, you develop the code incrementally, along with a test for that increment.
                 You don’t move on to the next increment until the code that you have
                 developed passes its test. Test-driven development was introduced as part of agile
                 methods such as Extreme Programming. However, it can also be used in plan-driven
                 development processes</p>

                        <center><img src="image/Image12.png"></center>

                        <p><b>  Figure 8.9 </b>  Test-driven developmen</p>

                  <p>The fundamental TDD process is shown in Figure 8.9. The steps in the process
                 are as follows:</p>

            
                     <p> 1. You start by identifying the increment of functionality that is required. This
                     should normally be small and implementable in a few lines of code</p>

                     <p> 2. You write a test for this functionality and implement this as an automated test.
                     This means that the test can be executed and will report whether or not it has
                     passed or failed.</p>

                     <p>3. You then run the test, along with all other tests that have been implemented.
                     Initially, you have not implemented the functionality so the new test will fail.
                     This is deliberate as it shows that the test adds something to the test set.</p>

                     <p> 4. You then implement the functionality and re-run the test. This may involve
                     refactoring existing code to improve it and add new code to what’s already there.</p>

                     <p> 5. Once all tests run successfully, you move on to implementing the next chunk of
                     functionality</p>
            

                     <p> An automated testing environment, such as the JUnit environment that supports
                 Java program testing (Massol and Husted, 2003), is essential for TDD. As the code
                 is developed in very small increments, you have to be able to run every test each time
                 that you add functionality or refactor the program. Therefore, the tests are embedded
                 in a separate program that runs the tests and invokes the system that is being tested.
                 Using this approach, it is possible to run hundreds of separate tests in a few seconds.</p>

                     <p> A strong argument for test-driven development is that it helps programmers clarify
                 their ideas of what a code segment is actually supposed to do. To write a test, you need
                 to understand what is intended, as this understanding makes it easier to write the
                 required code. Of course, if you have incomplete knowledge or understanding, then
                 test-driven development won’t help. If you don’t know enough to write the tests, you
                 won’t develop the required code. For example, if your computation involves division,
                 you should check that you are not dividing the numbers by zero. If you forget to write
                 a test for this, then the code to check will never be included in the program.</p>

                     <p> As well as better problem understanding, other benefits of test-driven development are:</p>
                        
                 

                        <p> 1. Code coverage In principle, every code segment that you write should have at
                     least one associated test. Therefore, you can be confident that all of the code in  the system has actually been executed. Code is tested as it is written so defects
                     are discovered early in the development process.</p>

                        <p>2. Regression testing A test suite is developed incrementally as a program is developed. 
                     You can always run regression tests to check that changes to the program
                     have not introduced new bugs.</p>

                         <p> 3. Simplified debugging When a test fails, it should be obvious where the problem lies. 
                     The newly written code needs to be checked and modified. You do not need
                     to use debugging tools to locate the problem. Reports of the use of test-driven
                     development suggest that it is hardly ever necessary to use an automated debugger 
                     in test-driven development (Martin, 2007).</p>

                        <p> 4. System documentation The tests themselves act as a form of documentation that
                      describe what the code should be doing. Reading the tests can make it easier to
                     understand the code</p>

                

                  <p> One of the most important benefits of test-driven development is that it reduces
                   the costs of regression testing. Regression testing involves running test sets that have
                   successfully executed after changes have been made to a system. The regression test
                   checks that these changes have not introduced new bugs into the system and that the
                   new code interacts as expected with the existing code. Regression testing is very
                   expensive and often impractical when a system is manually tested, as the costs in
                   time and effort are very high. In such situations, you have to try and choose the most
                   relevant tests to re-run and it is easy to miss important tests.</p>

                  <p> However, automated testing, which is fundamental to test-first development, dra
                    matically reduces the costs of regression testing. Existing tests may be re-run
                   quickly and cheaply. After making a change to a system in test-first development, all
                   existing tests must run successfully before any further functionality is added. As a
                   programmer, you can be confident that the new functionality that you have added has
                   not caused or revealed problems with existing code.</p>

                  <p>Test-driven development is of most use in new software development where the
                    functionality is either implemented in new code or by using well-tested standard
                    libraries. If you are reusing large code components or legacy systems then you need
                 to write tests for these systems as a whole. Test-driven development may also be
                 ineffective with multi-threaded systems. The different threads may be interleaved at
                 different times in different test runs, and so may produce different results.</p>


               <P> If you use test-driven development, you still need a system testing process to validate
                 the system; that is, to check that it meets the requirements of all of the system
                 stakeholders. System testing also tests performance, reliability, and checks that the
                 system does not do things that it shouldn’t do, such as produce unwanted outputs,
                 etc. Andrea (2007) suggests how testing tools can be extended to integrate some
                 aspects of system testing with TDD.</P>

               <P> Test-driven development has proved to be a successful approach for small and
                 medium-sized projects. Generally, programmers who have adopted this approach are
                 happy with it and find it a more productive way to develop software (Jeffries and Melnik, 2007). In some trials, it has been shown to lead to improved code quality; in
                 others, the results have been inconclusive. However, there is no evidence that TDD
                 leads to poorer quality code</P>


            <h2  style ="text-align: center; background-color: #23804b;">8.3 Release testing</h2>
                
            <ul>
               <p> Release testing is the process of testing a particular release of a system that is
                 intended for use outside of the development team. Normally, the system release is for
                 customers and users. In a complex project, however, the release could be for other
                 teams that are developing related systems. For software products, the release could
                 be for product management who then prepare it for sale.</p>

               <p> There are two important distinctions between release testing and system testing
                 during the development process:</p>
               
                
               <p> 1.A separ9ate team that has not been involved in the system development should be
                  responsible for release testing.</ul>

               <p> 2. System testing by the development team should focus on discovering bugs in the
                  system (defect testing). The objective of release testing is to check that the system
                  meets its requirements and is good enough for external use (validation testing).</p>
                 

               <p>Release testing is usually a black-box testing process where tests are derived from
                 the system specification. The system is treated as a black box whose behavior can
                 only be determined by studying its inputs and the related outputs. Another name for
                 this is ‘functional testing’, so-called because the tester is only concerned with functionality and
                 not the implementation of the software</p>

               </ul>


               <h2  style ="text-align: center; background-color: #23804b;"> 8.3.1 Requirements-based testing</h2>
                            
                  <p> A general principle of good requirements engineering practice is that requirements
                     should be testable; that is, the requirement should be written so that a test can be
                     designed for that requirement. A tester can then check that the requirement has been
                     satisfied. Requirements-based testing, therefore, is a systematic approach to test case
                     design where you consider each requirement and derive a set of tests for it.
                     Requirements-based testing is validation rather than defect testing—you are trying
                     to demonstrate that the system has properly implemented its requirements</p>
                            
                  <p> For example, consider related requirements for the MHC-PMS (introduced in
                   Chapter 1), which are concerned with checking for drug allergies:</p>

                    <p> If a patient is known to be allergic to any particular medication, then prescription 
                  of that medication shall result in a warning message being issued to thesystem user.</p>

                    <p> If a prescriber chooses to ignore an allergy warning, they shall provide a
                   reason why this has been ignored.</p>

                   <p>To check if these requirements have been satisfied, you may need to develop several related tests</p>

                

                  <p> 1. Set up a patient record with no known allergies. Prescribe medication for allergies
                         that are known to exist. Check that a warning message is not issued by the system.</p>

                                <p> 2. Set up a patient record with a known allergy. Prescribe the medication to that the
                         patient is allergic to, and check that the warning is issued by the system.</p>

                                <p> 3. Set up a patient record in which allergies to two or more drugs are recorded.
                         Prescribe both of these drugs separately and check that the correct warning for
                         each drug is issued.</p>

                                <p> 4. Prescribe two drugs that the patient is allergic to. Check that two warnings are
                         correctly issued</p>

                                <p> 5. Prescribe a drug that issues a warning and overrule that warning. Check that the
                         system requires the user to provide information explaining why the warning was
                         overruled</p>

                         <p> You can see from this that testing a requirement does not mean just writing a single test.
                         You normally have to write several tests to ensure that you have coverage of the requirement. 
                         You should also maintain traceability records of your requirements based testing, 
                         which link the tests to the specific requirements that are being tested.</p>

                        

                        <h2  style ="text-align: center; background-color: #23804b;"> 8.3.2 Scenario testing</h2>

                         <P>Scenario testing is an approach to release testing where you devise typical scenarios
                         of use and use these to develop test cases for the system. A scenario is a story that
                         describes one way in which the system might be used. Scenarios should be realistic
                         and real system users should be able to relate to them. If you have used scenarios as
                         part of the requirements engineering process (described in Chapter 4), then you may
                         be able to reuse these as testing scenarios.</P>

                         <P>In a short paper on scenario testing, Kaner (2003) suggests that a scenario test
                         should be a narrative story that is credible and fairly complex. It should motivate
                         stakeholders; that is, they should relate to the scenario and believe that it is important</P>

                            <center><img src="image/Image13.png"></center>

                            <p><b>   Figure 8.10  </b>  A usage scenario for the MHC-PMS</p>
                         
                        <P> that the system passes the test. He also suggests that it should be easy to evaluate. 
                     If there are problems with the system, then the release testing team should recognize
                     them. As an example of a possible scenario from the MHC-PMS, Figure 8.10
                     describes one way that the system may be used on a home visit.
                     It tests a number of features of the MHC-PMS:</P>

                             <P> 1. Authentication by logging on to the system.</P>

                             <P> 2. Downloading and uploading of specified patient records to a laptop.</P>

                             <P> 3. Home visit scheduling.</P>

                             <P> 4. Encryption and decryption of patient records on a mobile device.</P>

                             <P> 5. Record retrieval and modification.</P>

                             <P> 6. Links with the drugs database that maintains side-effect information.</P>

                             <P> 7. The system for call prompting.</P>

                         <P> If you are a release tester, you run through this scenario, playing the role of
                         Kate and observing how the system behaves in response to different inputs. As
                     ‘Kate’, you may make deliberate mistakes, such as inputting the wrong key
                     phrase to decode records. This checks the response of the system to errors. You
                     should carefully note any problems that arise, including performance problems. If
                     a system is too slow, this will change the way that it is used. For example, if it
                     takes too long to encrypt a record, then users who are short of time may skip this
                     stage. If they then lose their laptop, an unauthorized person could then view the
                     patient records.</P>

                         <P>When you use a scenario-based approach, you are normally testing several requirements
                     within the same scenario. Therefore, as well as checking individual requirements,
                     you are also checking that combinations of requirements do not cause problems.</P>

                        <P> Once a system has been completely integrated, it is possible to test for emergent properties, 
                 such as performance and reliability. Performance tests have to be designed to
                 ensure that the system can process its intended load. This usually involves running a
                 series of tests where you increase the load until the system performance becomes unacceptable.</P>

                        <P> As with other types of testing, performance testing is concerned both with
                 demonstrating that the system meets its requirements and discovering problems and
                 defects in the system. To test whether performance requirements are being
                 achieved, you may have to construct an operational profile. An operational profile
                 (see Chapter 15) is a set of tests that reflect the actual mix of work that will be handled by the system. 
                 Therefore, if 90% of the transactions in a system are of type A;
                 5% of type B; and the remainder of types C, D, and E, then you have to design the
                 operational profile so that the vast majority of tests are of type A. Otherwise, you
                 will not get an accurate test of the operational performance of the system.</P>

                         <P>This approach, of course, is not necessarily the best approach for defect testing.
                 Experience has shown that an effective way to discover defects is to design tests
                 around the limits of the system. In performance testing, this means stressing the system by
                 making demands that are outside the design limits of the software. This is
                 known as ‘stress testing’. For example, say you are testing a transaction processing
                 system that is designed to process up to 300 transactions per second. You start by
                 testing this system with fewer than 300 transactions per second. You then gradually
                 increase the load on the system beyond 300 transactions per second until it is well
                 beyond the maximum design load of the system and the system fails. This type of
                 testing has two functions:</P>

                            <P> 1. It tests the failure behavior of the system. Circumstances may arise through an
                 unexpected combination of events where the load placed on the system exceeds
                 the maximum anticipated load. In these circumstances, it is important that sys
                 tem failure should not cause data corruption or unexpected loss of user services.
                 Stress testing checks that overloading the system causes it to ‘fail-soft’ rather
                 than collapse under its load.</P>

                             <P> 2. It stresses the system and may cause defects to come to light that would not normally 
                 be discovered. Although it can be argued that these defects are unlikely to
                 cause system failures in normal usage, there may be unusual combinations of
                 normal circumstances that the stress testing replicates.</P>

                         <P> Stress testing is particularly relevant to distributed systems based on a network of
                 processors. These systems often exhibit severe degradation when they are heavily
                 loaded. The network becomes swamped with coordination data that the different
                 processes must exchange. The processes become slower and slower as they wait for
                 the required data from other processes. Stress testing helps you discover when the
                 degradation begins so that you can add checks to the system to reject transactions
                 beyond this point.</P>


               <H2  style ="text-align: center; background-color: #23804b;"> 8.4 User testing</H2>
                            
                  <P>User or customer testing is a stage in the testing process in which users or customers
                 provide input and advice on system testing. This may involve formally testing a system 
                 that has been commissioned from an external supplier, or could be an informal
                 process where users experiment with a new software product to see if they like it and
                 that it does what they need. User testing is essential, even when comprehensive system
                 and release testing have been carried out. The reason for this is that influences
                 from the user’s working environment have a major effect on the reliability, performance, usability, and robustness of a system.</P>

                         <P> It is practically impossible for a system developer to replicate the system’s working environment, 
                 as tests in the developer’s environment are inevitably artificial. For example, a system that is intended for use in a hospital is used in a clinical environment
                 where other t hings are going on, such as patient emergencies, conversation
                 with relatives, etc. These all affect the use of a system, but developers cannot include
                 them in their testing environment.</P>

                         <P>In practice, there are three different types of user testing:</P>

                                <P>1. Alpha testing, where users of the software work with the development team to
                             test the software at the developer’s site.</P>

                                <P>2. Beta testing, where a release of the software is made available to users to allow
                             them to experiment and to raise problems that they discover with the system
                             developers.</P>

                                <P>3. Acceptance testing, where customers test a system to decide whether or not it is
                             ready to be accepted from the system developers and deployed in the customer
                             environment.</P>

                         <P> In alpha testing, users and developers work together to test a system as it is being
                 developed. This means that the users can identify problems and issues that are not
                 readily apparent to the development testing team. Developers can only really work
                 from the requirements but these often do not reflect other factors that affect the practical 
                 use of the software. Users can therefore provide information about practice that
                 helps with the design of more realistic tests.</P>

                        <P>Alpha testing is often used when developing software products that are sold as
                 shrink-wrapped systems. Users of these products may be willing to get involved in
                 the alpha testing process because this gives them early information about new system features
                 that they can exploit. It also reduces the risk that unanticipated changes to the software will have disruptive effects on their business. However, alpha testing
                 may also be used when custom software is being developed. Agile methods, such as
                 XP, advocate user involvement in the development process and that users should
                 play a key role in designing tests for the system.</P>

                        <P> Beta testing takes place when an early, sometimes unfinished, release of a software system 
                        is made available to customers and users for evaluation. Beta testers.

                            <center><img src="image/Image13.png"></center>

                             <center><p><b>  Figure 8.11   </b>   The acceptance testing process</p></center>

                         <P> may be a selected group of customers who are early adopters of the system.
                 Alternatively, the software may be made publicly available for use by anyone who is
                 interested in it. Beta testing is mostly used for software products that are used in
                 many different environments (as opposed to custom systems which are generally
                 used in a defined environment). It is impossible for product developers to know and
                 replicate all the environments in which the software will be used. Beta testing is
                 therefore essential to discover interaction problems between the software and fea
                 tures of the environment where it is used. Beta testing is also a form of marketing—
                 customers learn about their system and what it can do for them.</P>

                         <P> Acceptance testing is an inherent part of custom systems development. It takes
                 place after release testing. It involves a customer formally testing a system to decide
                 whether or not it should be accepted from the system developer. Acceptance implies
                 that payment should be made for the system.</P>

                         <P>There are six stages in the acceptance testing process, as shown in Figure 8.11.They are:</P>

                                 <P> 1. Define acceptance criteria This stage should, ideally, take place early in the
                         process before the contract for the system is signed. The acceptance criteria
                         should be part of the system contract and be agreed between the customer and
                         the developer. In practice, however, it can be difficult to define criteria so early
                         in the process. Detailed requirements may not be available and there may be significant
                         requirements change during the development process.</P>

                                 <P> 2. Plan acceptance testing This involves deciding on the resources, time, and
                         budget for acceptance testing and establishing a testing schedule. The acceptance test plan 
                         should also discuss the required coverage of the requirements and the order in which system features are tested.
                         It should define risks to the testing process, such as system crashes and inadequate performance,
                         and discuss how these risks can be mitigated.</P>

                                 <P> 3. Derive acceptance tests Once acceptance criteria have been established, tests
                         have to be designed to check whether or not a system is acceptable. Acceptance
                         tests should aim to test both the functional and non-functional characteristics
                         (e.g., performance) of the system. They should, ideally, provide complete cover
                         age of the system requirements. In practice, it is difficult to establish completely
                         objective acceptance criteria. There is often scope for argument about whether
                         or not a test shows that a criterion has definitely been met.</P>

                                 <P>4. Run acceptance tests The agreed acceptance tests are executed on the system.
                            Ideally, this should take place in the actual environment where the system will
                            be used, but this may be disruptive and impractical. Therefore, a user testing
                            environment may have to be set up to run these tests. It is difficult to automate
                            this process as part of the acceptance tests may involve testing the interactions
                            between end-users and the system. Some training of end-users may be required.</P>

                                 <P> 5. Negotiate test results It is very unlikely that all of the defined acceptance tests will
                            pass and that there will be no problems with the system. If this is the case, then
                             acceptance testing is complete and the system can be handed over. More com
                             monly, some problems will be discovered. In such cases, the developer and the
                             customer have to negotiate to decide if the system is good enough to be put into
                            use. They must also agree on the developer’s response to identified problems.</P>

                                   <P>6. Reject/accept system This stage involves a meeting between the developers 
                            and the customer to decide on whether or not the system should be accepted. If
                            the system is not good enough for use, then further development is required
                            to fix the identified problems. Once complete, the acceptance testing phase is
                            repeated.</P>

                         <p>In agile methods, such as XP, acceptance testing has a rather different meaning. In
                     principle, it shares the notion that users should decide whether or not the system is
                     acceptable. However, in XP, the user is part of the development team (i.e., he or she
                     is an alpha tester) and provides the system requirements in terms of user stories. 
                     He or she is also responsible for defining the tests, which decide whether or not the
                     developed software supports the user story. The tests are automated and development
                     does not proceed until the story acceptance tests have passed. There is, therefore, no
                     separate acceptance testing activity.</p>

                        <p> As I have discussed in Chapter 3, one problem with user involvement is ensuring
                     that the user who is embedded in the development team is a ‘typical’ user with general 
                     knowledge of how the system will be used. It can be difficult to find such a user,
                     and so the acceptance tests may actually not be a true reflection of practice.
                     Furthermore, the requirement for automated testing severely limits the flexibility of
                     testing interactive systems. For such systems, acceptance testing may require groups
                     of end-users to use the system as if it was part of their everyday work.</p>

                        <p> You might think that acceptance testing is a clear-cut contractual issue. 
                     If a system does not pass its acceptance tests, then it should not be accepted and payment
                     should not be made. However, the reality is more complex. Customers want to use
                     the software as soon as they can because of the benefits of its immediate deployment. 
                     They may have bought new hardware, trained staff, and changed their
                     processes. They may be willing to accept the software, irrespective of problems,
                     because the costs of not using the software are greater than the costs of working
                     around the problems. Therefore, the outcome of negotiations may be conditional
                     acceptance of the system. The customer may accept the system so that deployment
                     can begin. The system provider agrees to repair urgent problems and deliver a new
                     version to the customer as quickly as possible</p>



                     <H2> KEY POINTS</H2>

                  <ul>
                        <li> Testing can only show the presence of errors in a program. It cannot demonstrate that there are no remaining faults.</li>

                        <li> Development testing is the responsibility of the software development team. A separate team should be responsible for testing 
                     a system before it is released to customers. In the user testing process, customers or system users provide test data and check that tests are successful.</li>
                        
                        <li> Development testing includes unit testing, in which you test individual objects and methods;
                     component testing, in which you test related groups of objects; and system testing, in which
                     you test partial or complete systems.</li>

                        <li>When testing software, you should try to ‘break’the software by using experience and guidelines
                     to choose types of test cases that have been effective in discovering defects in other systems.</li>
                        <li>Wherever possible, you should write automated tests. The tests are embedded 
                     in a program that can be run every time a change is made to a system.</li>

                        <li>Test-first development is an approach to development where tests are written before the code to
                     be tested. Small code changes are made and the code is refactored until all tests execute successfully.</li>

                        <li> Scenario testing is useful because it replicates the practical use of the system. It involves
                     inventing a typical usage scenario and using this to derive test cases.</li>
